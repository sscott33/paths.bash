Need to rename default bookmark so that it doesn't show up in any searches or calls unless directly named
    -> probably use something like "_default"
    -> should store this in a variable in case it needs to be changed due to user preference or edge case
    ** in pp: probably delete this from the loaded dict before doing regex lookup
    ** if renamed, that name should be printed with argumentless pp to ensure user can utilize it if desired

Need to migrate from echo to printf for printing of any strings starting with variables
    ** need to avoid edge cases where there are funky characters in something like a bookmark name (specifically '-e' and '-n')
